<h1>Styling a list for navigation</h1>
<p>It makes perfect sense to use a <code>ul</code> for a main navigation block. After all, isn't that a list of links?
</p>
<p>So we start with the html file “navigation.html”, which is essentially a <code>ul</code> with 5 <code>li</code>
    wrapped in a <code>nav</code> element. The only thing you are allowed to change in this file is adding a stylesheet
    <code>link</code> in the <code>head</code>.</p>
</body>

<h2>Version 1: nav for small screen</h2>
<p>Make a new CSS file (“style_mobilefirst.css”) to obtain screenshot1.</p>
<p>A few remarks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The different <code>li</code> elements are seperated by a small line</li>
    <li>The active link (the page where you are right now) has a ‘reversed effect’: dark letter on light background.
    </li>
    <li>The complete box of the <code>li</code> has to be clickable.</li>
    <li>Hovering over a link produces a color background color change. Make this even more nice by adding a transition
        of .3 seconds! (Documentation: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp">W3Schools on
            transition</a>)
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 2: Horizontal nav with <code>display: inline-block</code></h2>
<p>Make the list items <code>inline-block</code> to obtain the result in “screenshot2”.</p>


<p>There might be a problem with your solution to version 2. Perhaps you can spot a small gap between the list items.
    Try to find out where this gap comes from by using the developer tools (of FirefoxDevEdition).</p>

<p>If you try to fill the entire width of the screen with the five list items by setting the <code>width</code> of every
    <code>li</code> to 20%, you see how annoying this little gap between the li's becomes. Five times 20% + 4 times a
    small gap is greater than 100%.</p>

<p>This problem is documented in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/">an
    article on CSS-tricks</a>, which also provides some solutions.</p>

<p>Try some of these solutions which involve changing the html code of the list somewhat. The result should look like
    “screenshot3”, with no gap between the list items.</p>

<p>Make the list items <code>inline</code> and not <code>inline-block</code>. Describe the differences. (Documentation:
    <a href="https://medium.com/@DaphneWatson/css-display-properties-block-inline-and-inline-block-how-to-tell-the-difference-7d3a1e6e3051">medium.com</a>)
</p>

<h2>Ultimate Version: Horizontal nav with flex</h2>
<p>The previous versions are OK, but they don't give you a lot of <code>flex</code>ibility. Flexbox to the rescue! Might
    we suggest you use flexbox at least in one place in your own site? The main navigation would be an excellent choice.
</p>

<p>Change your CSS code to obtain “screenshot4”. Make the <code>ul</code> a flex container. Play around with different
    values for <code>justify-content</code>.</p>

<p>Make the flex items a third the size of the browser window and get the result of “screenshot5” in only of few lines
    of added code.</p>
